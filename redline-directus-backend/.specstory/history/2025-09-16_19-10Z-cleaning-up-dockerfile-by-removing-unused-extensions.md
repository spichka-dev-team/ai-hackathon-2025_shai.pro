_**Assistant**_

I'll remove the auth-otp and utils build/copy steps from your Directus Dockerfile, keeping only the base image and the directus-sync extension installation. 
```

```
I’ll clean up your Directus Dockerfile by removing the unused auth-otp and utils extension build/copy steps, leaving only directus-sync.

## actions taken
- Removed multi-stage builds for auth-otp and utils
- Removed their copy and npm install steps
- Kept the base Directus image and directus-sync installation
- Preserved permissions fix for the `node` user

## files changed
- `Dockerfile` — simplified to only install `directus-extension-sync`

## try it
- Build your image as usual; the image should be smaller and faster to build.

Requirements coverage:
- Remove unused copies for auth-otp and utils: Done.
