apply and add necessary packages from this text to the mine

_**Assistant**_

I'll add the required dependency from the RTMS quickstart into your extension's package.json so you can import and use it at runtime. I'll update your extension's package.json to add the RTMS package as a runtime dependency so you can import it, then confirm the change. 
```

```
I’ll pull the RTMS quickstart dependency into your extension so you can use it in code.

## Actions taken
- Updated `package.json` to add a runtime dependency:
  - dependencies: { "@zoom/rtms": "^0.0.2" }
- Left your existing scripts and devDependencies intact.

## What’s next
- Install packages and rebuild the extension:
  - Optional commands (PowerShell):
    ```
    cd ``
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
- In your extension code, you can now import RTMS, for example:
  - `import { RtmsClient } from '@zoom/rtms'`

If you want, I can wire a minimal usage sample into `src/index.js`.- In your extension code, you can now import RTMS, for example:
  - `import { RtmsClient } from '@zoom/rtms'`

_**Assistant**_

I'll quickly inspect the Dockerfile(s) to see how dependencies for extensions are installed so we can route installation through a Linux environment and avoid the Windows platform error. I'll quickly inspect docker-compose files to suggest a Docker-based install path that avoids Windows platform issues and confirm build context.
